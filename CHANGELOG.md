UIC (UI Components) is a set of Flutter widgets that simplifies implementing most used UI cases.

Each UIC widget uses standard Flutter widgets to implements its view, but adds additional logic, like state management, and parameters to customize its appearance.

Here is the list of available components:
- `ListUic` - Wrapper of ListView, which implements related data loading and state management logic.
- `ProgressUic` - Wrapper of ProgressIndicator with additional text.
